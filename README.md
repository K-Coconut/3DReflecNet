## [Homepage](https://k-coconut.github.io/3DReflecNet/) & Dataset

Please refer to our new [Website](https://k-coconut.github.io/3DReflecNet/) ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

- Due to the storage constraint by github, we show partially demo instances for quick reference. We will deploy full service on cloud service when security check approved.
- Before that, the demo dataset (~1T) can be downloaded via [Sharepoint](https://cuhko365.sharepoint.com/sites/CUHKSZ-SSE-INML/SitePages/Home.aspx?e=1:aab1118873e1469f8e893dd8205a3a99) and Full dataset (>22T) can be requested via email at zhichengliang1@link.cuhk.edu.cn (Due to the large volume of data, it is vulnerable to DDoS attacks. **During the paperâ€™s review process, we do not require any identity verification**).
